# rssitter
Rssitter allows you to follow your favourite twitters without Twitter even knowing it. Rssitter uses [Nitter's](nitter.net) rss feed in order to gather the latest tweets from your favourite accounts and builds a *twitter-like* feed so you can read them. We will never connect you to Twitter so your privacy is safe using Rssitter.

At the moment, *rssitter* i **serverless** but I'm working on a *node.js* implementation so you can follow your accounts and have a user. At the moment the best way to use it is to download the two files and use it locally.

## Use it with 5 simple steps.
1. Download or clone this repo.
2. Open `js/fetch.js` with your favourite editor.
3. Enter your favourite rss feeds to the `rss_list` variable.
4. Open `index.html` with your browser.
5. Enjoy
